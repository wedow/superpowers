# Superpowers Release Notes

## v2.0.2 (2025-10-12)

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed false warning when local skills repo is ahead of upstream** - The initialization script was incorrectly warning "New skills available from upstream" when the local repository had commits ahead of upstream. The logic now correctly distinguishes between three git states: local behind (should update), local ahead (no warning), and diverged (should warn).

## v2.0.1 (2025-10-12)

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed session-start hook execution in plugin context** (#8, PR #9) - The hook was failing silently with "Plugin hook error" preventing skills context from loading. Fixed by:
  - Using `${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}` fallback when BASH_SOURCE is unbound in Claude Code's execution context
  - Adding `|| true` to handle empty grep results gracefully when filtering status flags

# Superpowers v2.0.0 Release Notes

## Overview

Superpowers v2.0 makes skills more accessible, maintainable, and community-driven through a major architectural shift.

The headline change is **skills repository separation**: all skills, scripts, and documentation have moved from the plugin into a dedicated repository ([obra/superpowers-skills](https://github.com/obra/superpowers-skills)). This transforms superpowers from a monolithic plugin into a lightweight shim that manages a local clone of the skills repository. Skills auto-update on session start. Users fork and contribute improvements via standard git workflows. The skills library versions independently from the plugin.

Beyond infrastructure, this release adds nine new skills focused on problem-solving, research, and architecture. We rewrote the core **using-skills** documentation with imperative tone and clearer structure, making it easier for Claude to understand when and how to use skills. **find-skills** now outputs paths you can paste directly into the Read tool, eliminating friction in the skills discovery workflow.

Users experience seamless operation: the plugin handles cloning, forking, and updating automatically. Contributors find the new architecture makes improving and sharing skills trivial. This release lays the foundation for skills to evolve rapidly as a community resource.

## Breaking Changes

### Skills Repository Separation

**The biggest change:** Skills no longer live in the plugin. They've been moved to a separate repository at [obra/superpowers-skills](https://github.com/obra/superpowers-skills).

**What this means for you:**

- **First install:** Plugin automatically clones skills to `~/.config/superpowers/skills/`
- **Forking:** During setup, you'll be offered the option to fork the skills repo (if `gh` is installed)
- **Updates:** Skills auto-update on session start (fast-forward when possible)
- **Contributing:** Work on branches, commit locally, submit PRs to upstream
- **No more shadowing:** Old two-tier system (personal/core) replaced with single-repo branch workflow

**Migration:**

If you have an existing installation:
1. Your old `~/.config/superpowers/.git` will be backed up to `~/.config/superpowers/.git.bak`
2. Old skills will be backed up to `~/.config/superpowers/skills.bak`
3. Fresh clone of obra/superpowers-skills will be created at `~/.config/superpowers/skills/`

### Removed Features

- **Personal superpowers overlay system** - Replaced with git branch workflow
- **setup-personal-superpowers hook** - Replaced by initialize-skills.sh

## New Features

### Skills Repository Infrastructure

**Automatic Clone & Setup** (`lib/initialize-skills.sh`)
- Clones obra/superpowers-skills on first run

- Handles migration from old installation

**Auto-Update**
- Fetches from tracking remote on every session start
- Auto-merges with fast-forward when possible
- Notifies when manual sync needed (branch diverged)

### New Skills

**Problem-Solving Skills** (`skills/problem-solving/`)
- **collision-zone-thinking** - Force unrelated concepts together for emergent insights
- **inversion-exercise** - Flip assumptions to reveal hidden constraints
- **meta-pattern-recognition** - Spot universal principles across domains
- **scale-game** - Test at extremes to expose fundamental truths
- **simplification-cascades** - Find insights that eliminate multiple components
- **when-stuck** - Dispatch to right problem-solving technique
